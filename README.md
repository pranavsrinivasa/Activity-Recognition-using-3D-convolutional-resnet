# Human Activity Recognition on UCF-101 Dataset using 3D Convolutional ResNet and CNN-LSTM Architectures

This project addresses Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on the UCF-101 dataset, comparing the results of two powerful architectures: 3D Convolutional ResNet and CNN-LSTM. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook  offers a detailed exploration of the implementation and performance evaluation.

## Project Overview

HAR is a critical task in computer vision, and this project custom 3D residual CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures for activity recognition on the UCF-101 dataset. The 3D Convolutional ResNet captures spatial and temporal features, while the CNN-LSTM combines convolutional and recurrent layers for dynamic sequence modeling.

## Key Features

- **3D Convolutional ResNet:** Implements a Residual Neural Network with 3D convolutions to capture spatiotemporal dependencies in video frames.

- **CNN-LSTM Architecture:** Combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to effectively model sequential information in videos.

## Results Comparison

The project meticulously compares the performance of 3D Convolutional ResNet and CNN-LSTM architectures, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses in the context of Human Activity Recognition on the UCF-101 dataset.
